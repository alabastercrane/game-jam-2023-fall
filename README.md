This is a game with the prompty: Strange Machines. Players find themselves in a futuristic metal based world where they encounter a remarkable, bug with the power to consume and integrate metal components from the enemies it defeats. As they control and modify this bug, they must navigate a complex, ever-changing landscape, solving puzzles, overcoming obstacles, and battling enemies by harnessing the bug's unique abilities that change based on what it consumes. Players must strike a balance between enhancing their bug's capabilities and preventing it from becoming too powerful (we talked about it having a limited memory?), and fight enemies (are these our strange machines or is the bug the strange machine)   while also unraveling the mysteries of the metal-based world through puzzle solving
